# webgl-physics-cyclone

A bug weighted reimplementation of "Game Physics Engine Development" (I.Miller, Morgan Kaufmann) Cyclone-Physics-Engine
With, i did not remove some Code from "Core HTML5 Canvas", one of the best canvas books, one had the aim to write one. 
I used GLMatrix and read a WebGL Beginners Guide and formerly Professional WebGL and wrote my own one for this physics engine.

This thing is not completed and released just for fun.

Whatever - update (even without testing, but correcting the books code again
and cleaning this file up, since i post it just now) at an unknown, but relativly near point.

Apropos points, how to apply stuff at some points, it´s all in his book, the file has contact generation,
maybe with the need for some corrections, but just look and get the old book from 2006. Then get a "better".
